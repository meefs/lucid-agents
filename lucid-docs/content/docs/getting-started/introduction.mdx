Lucid Agents is a TypeScript-first framework for building and monetizing AI agents. It provides the infrastructure for agents that sell services, accept payments, and communicate with other agents.

## What is Lucid Agents?

Lucid Agents is an agentic commerce and payments SDK. Build AI agents that:

- **Accept payments** in USDC on Ethereum L2s (Base) or Solana with automatic paywall middleware
- **Communicate with other agents** via the A2A protocol, enabling agent marketplaces and multi-agent systems
- **Establish on-chain identity** using ERC-8004 for reputation and trust
- **Deploy anywhere** with framework adapters for Hono, TanStack Start, Express, and Next.js

## Core capabilities

### Industry-standard protocols

Native support for protocols that let your agents work within the ecosystem:

- **x402** - HTTP-native payment protocol for monetizing agent capabilities
- **A2A** - Agent-to-Agent communication for discovery and interoperability
- **ERC-8004** - On-chain identity standard for verifiable agent reputation

### Type-safe APIs

Define inputs and outputs with Zod schemas. Get automatic validation, JSON schema generation, and full TypeScript inference.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const entrypoint = {
  key: 'analyze',
  input: z.object({
    text: z.string(),
    language: z.enum(['en', 'es', 'fr']),
  }),
  output: z.object({
    sentiment: z.number(),
    keywords: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  async handler({ input }) {
    // TypeScript knows input.text and input.language types
    return { output: { sentiment: 0.8, keywords: ['example'] } };
  },
};
```

### Framework flexibility

Write your agent logic once, deploy on your preferred framework:

- **Hono** - Lightweight, edge-compatible HTTP server
- **TanStack Start** - Full-stack React with UI dashboard or headless API
- **Express** - Traditional Node.js HTTP server
- **Next.js** - Next.js App Router integration

### Composable architecture

Add only the features you need. Extensions are independent modules you can mix and match:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from '@lucid-agents/core';
import { http } from '@lucid-agents/http';
import { payments } from '@lucid-agents/payments';
import { identity } from '@lucid-agents/identity';
import { a2a } from '@lucid-agents/a2a';

const agent = await createAgent({
  name: 'my-agent',
  version: '1.0.0',
})
  .use(http())
  .use(payments({ config: paymentsFromEnv() }))
  .use(identity({ config: identityFromEnv() }))
  .use(a2a())
  .build();
```

## Use cases

Lucid Agents is designed for:

- **Paid AI services** - Monetize LLM-powered capabilities with per-request pricing
- **Agent marketplaces** - Build agents that discover and purchase services from other agents
- **Multi-agent systems** - Create networks of specialized agents that collaborate
- **Verifiable AI** - Establish trust through on-chain identity and reputation

## Architecture overview

The SDK is organized into layers:

1. **Core** - Protocol-agnostic agent runtime with extension system (`@lucid-agents/core`)
2. **Extensions** - Optional capabilities: `http()`, `payments()`, `identity()`, `a2a()`, `ap2()`, `wallets()`
3. **Adapters** - Framework integrations that use the HTTP extension (hono, tanstack, express, next)

The core runtime is completely protocol-agnostic. HTTP is provided as an extension, and future protocols (gRPC, WebSocket) can be added the same way.
