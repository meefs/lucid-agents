Release packages that were missed in 2.4.0 release

These packages were not included in the 2.4.0 release and are still depending on @lucid-agents/types@1.5.7. This release brings them up to date so they depend on types@1.6.0 with the CAIP-2 Network type, resolving potential type conflicts in dependency trees.
