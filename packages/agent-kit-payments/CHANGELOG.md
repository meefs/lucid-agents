### Minor Changes

- 5e192fe: # Payment Logic Extraction and Next.js Adapter

  This release introduces the Next.js adapter for building full-stack agent applications, completes the extraction of all payment-related logic from `agent-kit` into `agent-kit-payments`, establishes correct package boundaries, and reorganizes types to be co-located with their features.

  ## New Features

  ### Next.js Adapter
  - **Full-stack React framework** - Build agent applications with Next.js App Router
  - **Client dashboard** - Interactive UI for testing entrypoints with AppKit wallet integration
  - **x402 payment middleware** - Server-side paywall using `x402-next` middleware
  - **SSR-compatible** - Server-Side Rendering support with proper cache management
  - **Multi-network wallet support** - EVM (Base, Ethereum) and Solana via AppKit/WalletConnect

  **Key files:**
  - `app/api/agent/*` - HTTP endpoints backed by agent runtime handlers
  - `proxy.ts` - x402 paywall middleware for payment enforcement
  - `components/dashboard.tsx` - Client dashboard for testing entrypoints
  - `lib/paywall.ts` - Dynamic route pricing configuration
  - `components/AppKitProvider.tsx` - Wallet connection provider

  **Usage:**

  ```bash
  bunx @lucid-agents/create-agent-kit my-agent --adapter=next
  ```

  **Features:**
  - Interactive entrypoint testing with form validation
  - Real-time SSE streaming support
  - Wallet connection with AppKit (EVM + Solana)
  - Payment flow testing with x402 protocol
  - Manifest and health endpoint viewing
  - Code snippet generation for API calls

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### Dependency Structure Clarified
  - Extensions (`agent-kit-identity`, `agent-kit-payments`) are now independent of each other
  - `agent-kit` depends on both extensions
  - `agent-kit-payments` imports `EntrypointDef` from `agent-kit`
  - Build order: identity → payments → agent-kit → adapters

  ### Type Locations Changed
  - `EntrypointDef` moved to `agent-kit/src/http/types.ts` - co-located with HTTP types
  - Stream types moved to `http/types.ts` - co-located with HTTP/SSE functionality
  - Deleted `agent-kit/src/types.ts` - types now co-located with features
  - Core types (`AgentMeta`, `AgentContext`, `Usage`) remain in `core/types.ts`
  - Crypto utilities (`sanitizeAddress`, `ZERO_ADDRESS`) added to `crypto/address.ts`

  ### Import Path Changes

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  import type { EntrypointDef } from '@lucid-agents/agent-kit';
  ```

  **After (unchanged):**

  ```typescript
  import type { EntrypointDef } from '@lucid-agents/agent-kit';
  ```

  **For payment types:**

  ```typescript
  import type { PaymentsConfig } from '@lucid-agents/agent-kit-payments';
  ```

  ## Architectural Changes

  ### Files Deleted from agent-kit
  - `src/types.ts` - Central types file deleted; types now co-located with features
  - `src/http/payments.ts` - Payment requirement logic moved to agent-kit-payments
  - `src/runtime.ts` - Runtime payment context moved to agent-kit-payments
  - `src/utils/axllm.ts` - Moved to `src/axllm/index.ts`

  ### Package Boundaries Clarified

  **agent-kit-payments** contains ALL x402 protocol code:
  - Payment configuration types
  - Payment requirement resolution
  - 402 response generation
  - x402 client utilities (making payments)
  - Runtime payment context (wallet integration)
  - AxLLM integration with x402

  **agent-kit** contains:
  - Core types (AgentMeta, AgentContext, Usage)
  - HTTP types (EntrypointDef, StreamEnvelope, etc.)
  - Core runtime (AgentCore, handlers)
  - HTTP runtime and SSE streaming
  - Manifest generation
  - Config management
  - UI landing page
  - Crypto utilities (sanitizeAddress)

  ### AxLLM Reorganization
  - Moved from `src/utils/axllm.ts` to `src/axllm/index.ts`
  - Rationale: Isolated for future extraction into separate package
  - Updated package.json exports: `./axllm` instead of `./utils/axllm`

  ## Migration Guide

  ### For Package Consumers

  `EntrypointDef` remains in `agent-kit`, so existing imports continue to work:

  ```typescript
  // EntrypointDef stays in agent-kit
  import type { EntrypointDef } from '@lucid-agents/agent-kit';

  // Payment configuration from agent-kit-payments
  import type { PaymentsConfig } from '@lucid-agents/agent-kit-payments';
  ```

  ### For Package Contributors
  - Types are now co-located with features (no central types file)
  - Payment logic belongs in `agent-kit-payments`
  - agent-kit-payments must build before agent-kit

  ## Bug Fixes

  ### Type Inference for Entrypoint Handlers

  **Fixed:** `addEntrypoint()` now properly infers input/output types from Zod schemas.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  addEntrypoint({
    input: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
    handler: async ({ input }) => {
      // Bug: input has type 'unknown' even with schema
      const msg = input.message; // ❌ Type error
    },
  });
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  addEntrypoint({
    input: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
    handler: async ({ input }) => {
      // Fixed: input has type { message: string }
      const msg = input.message; // ✅ Works!
    },
  });
  ```
